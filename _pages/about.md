I am a master’s student specializing in Digital Humanities at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/). My research interests include the application of geoinformation, particularly in human mobility.

Previously, I earned my bachelor’s degree in Geography and Geoinformation from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/en), conducting research at the [Center for GIS, Academia Sinica](https://gis.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/). I also worked as a product manager and data analyst intern at [H2U](https://www.h2u.io/en), leading the digital transformation of [HikingNotes](https://hiking.biji.co/), a leading hiking app and platform in Taiwan.

In my free time, I enjoy challenging myself. I've been training for athletics for 5+ years, with a personal best of 1:16:02 in half marathon. I have 1.5 years coaching experience at the [NCCU EMBA running club](https://www.nccu.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en). Running is not just a sport to me — it’s a lifestyle that shapes my discipline, resilience, and mindset, both in academics and in life.
